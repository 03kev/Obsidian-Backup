- [x] Alfred: The shortcut workflow has the ability to let you choose the action from the universal action panel. Add this to the pdf workflow
- [x] Fix x2 F6 on karabiner. One possible fix would be to add in system settings the shortcut of Focus mode to f6, but i'd like to avoid this solution because i want f6 to be available
	- [x] Add that when holding F6, it shuts down the computer. Already done a part of it, but the problem is that it also does the normal F6 clicked action, that is the don't disturb mode. Fixed it by activating f6 again: two times f6 = no times f6. <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Would be better finding another solution, but at least this works.</span>

- [x] Add keyboard brightness control to fn+F1 and fn+F2
- [x] Fix Alfred system groups icons and the fact that, for example, the battery panel opens the appearence one <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Fixed only with the workflow (that is better, bu the icons are still missing)</span>
