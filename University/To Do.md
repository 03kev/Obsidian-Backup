- [ ] Alfred: The shortcut workflow has the ability to let you choose the action from the universal action panel. Add this to the pdf workflow
- [x] Fix x2 F6 on karabiner. One possible fix would be to add in system settings the shortcut of Focus mode to f6, but i'd like to avoid this solution because i want f6 to be available
	- [x] Add that when holding F6, it shuts down the computer. Already done a part of it, but the problem is that it also does the normal F6 clicked action, that is the don't disturb mode. Fixed it by activating f6 again: two times f6 = no times f6. <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Would be better finding another solution, but at least this works.</span>
- [ ] https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/jy5ry8/m1_macbook_air_keysshortcut_for_keyboard/ check if i can use this instead of karabiner
- [x] Add keyboard brightness control to fn+F1 and fn+F2
- [x] Fix Alfred system groups icons and the fact that, for example, the battery panel opens the appearence one <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Fixed only with the workflow (that is better, bu the icons are still missing)</span>
- [x] Any kind of workflow/shortcut in order to open silicio EVERY time that I'll open spotify, and also to maybe close them both toghether
- [x] Open spotify when pressing F8 instead of iTunes (that has to work when there is no audio or video in the background that can start or that can be paused)
      Done using noTunes
- [ ] Hide applications, like logisim, from launchpad
- [x] Check both shortery and bettertouchtool
      Both are great tools that can do in their full version lots of things
- [ ] check if i can hide some shortcuts from the sc workflow in alfred, for example the ones that are only needed in shortery.
